(update nerfed the animated json models so looking for time to put the modeler/animator hat on)

Relaxing at home on a cold November day and looking out at dull houses and streets, I wanted to see this snowy winter scene

I had a lot of fun making it.

- Rigged and Animated a free Snowman character that follows the camera
- Made Custom Mobile and W,A,S,D, + Arrow movement controls (I've never played a game on my phone so just made up something that seems to work)
- Heightmap generated ground
- Random placement of trees
- Random placement of deer and a wolf from old free models (will rebuild and animate eventually)
- Custom trees built from primitives objects randomly placed
- Generic Skybox
- Moon Sprite
- Falling snow (looks nice but isn't very efficient)

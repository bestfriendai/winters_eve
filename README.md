December 2022 Major Update

Organized everything into classes and took a less weeeee-this-is-fun approach.

Added and Mixamo animated a "player" character with a basic chase camera

TODOs: work on the deer and wolf and their animations and that's up next

Relaxing at home on a cold December day and looking out at dull houses and streets, I wanted to see this snowy winter scene

I had a lot of fun making it.

- Rigged and Animated a free Snowman character that follows the player around
- Mixamo animated and added a player character (snoopy)
- Made Custom Mobile and W,A,S,D, + Arrow movement controls (I've never played a game on my phone so just made up something that seems to work)
- Heightmap generated ground
- Random placement of trees
- Random placement of deer and a wolf from old free models (will rebuild and animate eventually)
- Custom trees built from primitives objects randomly placed
- Generic Skybox
- Moon Sprite
- Falling snow (looks nice but probably not as efficient as I'd like)


TODOs:
update touch controls
handle backward and side animation
